# FPGA-Priority-Encoder-8x3

In this project I have made the synthesizable RTL SystemVerilog design code for the 8x3 Priority Encoder. In this design I have made sure to use the synthesizable constructs as in case statements over if-else statement to avoid the priority miscalculations. And realized the RTL design schematic using the Vivado. Further, using the Vivado synthesis tool, and with the help of the lookup table the Synthesized LUT schematic was attained. The RTL design was verified by the separete SytemVerilog testbench.
